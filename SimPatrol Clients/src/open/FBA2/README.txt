 This package contains the code for the Open flexible bidder agent.
 It is the adaptation of the Flexible Bidder Agent 2 to the open system setting

 The Open_FBA_Agent is the main class and do not contain the ENTER and QUIT mechanism. 
 It is designed to work with any well-designed ENTER and QUIT mechanisms respecting a few constraints given in the class file.
 
 
 Open_FBA_Random_Agent, Open_FBA_Nodes_Agent, Open_FBA_Group_Agent, Open_FBA_Proximity_Agent and Open_FBA_PrecalculatedGroup_Agent
 are examples of ENTER and QUIT mechanisms. The ENTER and QUIT mechanisms can be mixed, as they are independant.
