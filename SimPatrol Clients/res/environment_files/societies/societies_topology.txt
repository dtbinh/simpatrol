This is the topology used for naming the societies' files :

soc_X_YY(_ZZ)(_limited).xml

==> X = 0 || 1 : coordinator (1) or no coordinator (2)
The coordinator has perceptions 0, 1, 3 and 4 and actions 1, 2, 3. No limitations in depth or stamina

==> YY : number of agents other than coordinator
They have perceptions 0, 1, 3 and 4 and actions 1, 2, 3. No limitations in depth or stamina

==> ZZ : when there is a 2nd number, then :
	YY is the number of agents at the beginning of the simulation
	ZZ the number of agents at the end.
the agents missing die at t=1000 with a probability of 1

==> limited : the agents have perceptions 0 with a depth limitation of 1, and 4. They have actions 1 and 2.




IMPORTANT : when using these societies, remember to change the starting nodes of agents to a node existing in your map
