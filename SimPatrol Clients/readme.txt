This project has the implementation of some agents presented in the literature.

These agents, in the future, will be ported to the new library for agents' creation,
in the project "SimPatrol New Clients". 

Some were already ported and were already removed from this project.

Many of the remaining agents are only compatible with version 1.2 of SimPatrol 
(because of a change in how coordinator agents are treated by the server).
